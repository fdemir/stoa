# Stoa

Stoa is a primitive unstyled UI library for building high-quality, accessible, and performant web applications with React. It consists of accessibility and developer experience in mind.

### Vision

There are some common UI elements which are dropdown, slider, accordion, and toggle etc. These elements are used in many web applications. However, there are some non-primitive UI libraries that provide these elements. Developers have to use those libraries and customize them. But it is not easy to customize them. Because they are not primitive. They are a component with a lot of logic and styles. So, developers have to override styles and logic. It is not easy to override styles and logic. It is not easy to maintain them.

Our goal is to provide a set of components that are accessible, performant, and easy to use.

_keep it simple_

### Key Features

**Developer experience**

Primitive components are designed to be used as building blocks for your own components. They are unstyled and unopinionated, so you can build your own design system on top of them. Their configurations are simple and easy to understand, so you can easily customize them to fit your needs.

**Unstyled**

All components and their parts come unstyled out of the box. You can style them with your own CSS(include pre-precessors) or use a CSS-in-JS library.

**Pure**

Primitive components simply act like pure functions. They don't have any side effects and don't use any global state. This makes them easy to test and reason about.

**Single**

For projects with package size requirements, you can import only the components you need.

Stoa guarantees that all components are tree-shakeable and does not depend each other. Only shares between components are utils and hooks.
